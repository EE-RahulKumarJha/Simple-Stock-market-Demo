# Simple-Stock-market-Demo

This program defines two classes, Stock and StockMarket, and demonstrates their usage.

The Stock class represents a stock with a symbol and a price, and has a method to update the price based on a random fluctuation. The StockMarket class manages a collection of stocks and has methods to add stocks, update their prices, and get the current price of a given stock by symbol.

In the main block, a StockMarket object is created and three stocks are added with initial prices. Then, the prices are updated 10 times and printed for each stock.

This program shows how object-oriented programming can be used to model complex systems like a stock market, and how simulations can be used to study the behavior of such systems under different conditions.
